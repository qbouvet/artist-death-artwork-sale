308661,0792840461,"Everybody knows banks, whether in storefronts, in supermarket lobbies, or in marbled edifices, is where the money is. A lot of people also know of the old yegg, Willie Sutton and his famous, or infamous, remark when asked why he robbed banks and noted sardonically that was where the money was. The question posed by the film under review, The Thomas Crown Affair, is why was a guy who has plenty of money (some four million dollars, yes, pocket change today, hardly walking around money, but a substantial amount in 1967) winding up as the prime suspect in a major Boston bank robbery. Strangely enough Thomas Crown&#8217;s answer is very much like Brother Sutton&#8217;s-that is where the dough is.Here is the skinny. Wealthy Boston socialite, divorced socialite and that is important since he is a little skirt-crazy, Thomas Crown (played by the blue-eyed devil Steve McQueen) is bored/intrigued/into risk-taking on a big scale who plans capers, you know, bank heists, basically for the sake of doing them. And mainly he gets away with them because he hires guys who don&#8217;t know each other or him on a contract basis and so he is somewhat immune to being ratted on by snitches and guys turning over on him when the heat is on. This is the M.O. (modus operandi, okay) that gets him big dough in a downtown Boston heist as the film opens. And finding out who and what this non-criminal criminal is drives the action in this film.Naturally the Boston cops are clueless about how to handle such a case where it appears that the job was done seamlessly, there was no word on the street about the dough, the multitude of witnesses, bank employees and clients had a multitude of stories and they have to go outside the doughnut shop where they usually hang out. Enter one drop-dead female insurance investigator (played by Faye Dunaway) who has a serious reputation of getting the hard bank heists cases solved for a serious cut of the recovery money. So Faye goes to work, gets very close, too close in the end, to this wizard socialite Crown who has a serious case of getting his kicks by high risk actions. Oh yeah, but wait a minute we have Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in this one, two iconic beautiful people from the 1960s so you know that, well, sex has to show up or this might as well have been a film noir, or something. So sure they ruffle up some sheets, make that plenty of sheets, and Faye gets a little religion about Steve. Or maybe she was just like a lot of people wondering why a guy with dough was robbing for dough like she had never heard of Brother Willie Hutton.[Note: This film was re-made in the 1990s with Pierce Brosnan in the title role. One big different between the two was the speed of the action in the latter film was much faster than the laconic unfolding of the scenes in this film. Even I found this earlier film rather too slow which may reflect the change-up in the demand for more action per minute in action films these latter days.]",Where The Dough Is,2014-04-05,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308671,0792840461,"Thomas Crown was a mega-millionaire Ivy League educated Boston Brahmin (Dartmouth undergrad, Harvard M.B.A.) in search of adventure and identity..At a time when America outwardly celebrated the protestations of the anti-hero: this was the late 60's when Viet Nam, Watergate, and the Cold War were in play..Thomas Crown's caper involved clipping the insurance companies, through a circuitous backchannel..By robbing a bank, hence knocking off the establishment..And Crown pre-planned the heist in geometric detail, executed like a Wallstreet raid, the crime without trace, including never meeting his accomplices face to face, nor they meeting each other..Therefore, he couldn't cough them up, nor they him, if the job derailed..Faye Dunaway (Vicki) was the Coco Chanel coutured super sleuth, brought in by the insurance company to bust the brainiac behind the elaborate caper for a fee of 10% of all monies recovered..Unfortunately, our nemesises found themselves to be more than mildly simpatico..Both unrepetant mercenaries, and beautifully chiseled people, in a word, heartless soulmates..Vicki plucks Crown from a cross-file of suspects who had worked at the bank, and knew the inside layout, and had made multiple overnighters to Switzerland..But Vicki id'ed Crown moreso from a photo: was aroused by his monochromatic blue eyes, his apparent charisma, thought he was the likely leo behind the heist..And the cat and mouse charade was game on..Vicki stalks Crown at polo matches, art house auctions, and makes conspicuous home movies of Crown..Crown spots her later at an auction and approaches her..On first introduction he asks, who are you and what is your racket?..She says insurance, I'm a headhunter..He says, just whose head are you after..She says, yours of course, you know, the bank caper! He says, do you always get your your man..She says, oh I hope so!..Inevitably, romance ensues..The plot thickens when Crown tells Vicki, following an intimate moment, he will rob the bank again, because he's gotta know if Vicki will fink him out again, given a second swipe..Norman Jewison, the film's director, found the story of the Thomas Crown Affair in a forgotten stack of manuscripts, and went to see the author..Found the writer to be a novice screenwriter, and a restless Ivy League attorney turned daydreamer, who lived in an apartment with a 180% view of a high payroll Boston bank..Norman Jewison was the ideal director to make this F. Truffaunt inspired film, and to mentor Steve McQueen through the process..McQueen was never better, though on first blush McQueen was the unlikeliest actor to play the part credibly, since at the time he didn't own a single suit..But McQueen was Thomas Crown, the ubiquitous Phi Beta Kappa key hanging dapperly from his three piece Oxford suits, a subtle yet obvious conceit..On the first date, Vicki asks Crown, ""Are you taking me home to meet Mother"", Crown replies sardonically, ""Wall to wall carpeting..something""..Vicki had illegally surveiled his townhouse by pretending to be a carpet measurement crew to Crown's butler, to gain access to Crown's Queen Anne brownstone, resplendent with priceless oriental rugs?..Vicki's obvious underestimation of Crown's sense of aesthetics..And sicced the IRS on Crown, had him thoroughly staked out, monitored around the clock..So Crown renews an old fling with a European model to remind Vicki who holds the high cards in their blood stakes game of cops and robbers..The surveilance photos of Crown with another woman drives Vicki to kinetic fits of jealousy..Even Vicki is shocked at her territorialism!..Paul Burke, a New Orleans born actor/detective tells her, ""Vicki girl you're being had,, you want to know where he went last night after he left you? that's the third time he's seen her this week, here see for yourself""..Crown knows Vicki better than she knows herself, and reckons Vicki will in the end betray him..Crown robs the same bank a second time, but confides in Vicki when and where the drop-off will be..And Vicki awaits Crown in a cemetery with her colleagues to nab him..Only to receive a telegram from Crown's driver in his Rolls-Royce..Sorry Vicki I left early, bring the money or you keep the Rolls-Royce..While Jewison cuts away to Crown on the Concorde, first class to Geneva..Though Crown wins the near-term war of wits, both he and Vicki lose the big prize..They both know, but never say, they will remain in character and sell-out any possibility of a life together, to achieve some other metric of glory..Though they shared some imported champagne and caviar trying!..Oh, and what to make of those overly dedicated career people?",Keys That Jingle In Your Pocket !,2005-07-10,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"
308672,0792840461,"Director Norman Jewison saw visuals in multi-shaped boxes at the 1964 Worlds Fair. Jewison was more of an experimentalist than a stylist, and would try anything once.He used what he saw in the Thomas Crown Affair in 1968. The storyline of the film is straightforward: a millionaire, Steve McQueen, robs for the hell of it and has an affair with a beautiful women, Faye Dunaway.Solid: but Jewison's innovation here pays tenfold. He makes the aforementioned boxes divide the screen. Different shapes, different subplots, different characters--all at once.This is visually stunning. If you can envision those big front window treatments so many split level houses built in the early 1960s had in their fronts--squares and rectangles of different dimensions--this film adopts the same modernist device.Without plot, this would be an indulgence. But Jewison never places style ahead of story here, and so both work beautifully--art and entertainment welded perfect at the hip.",Excellent,2010-09-02,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"
308673,0792840461,"More time capsule than time warp. &#34;The Thomas Crown Affair&#34; brought back my hometown of Boston frozen in amber in 1968: no skyscrapers, no Quincy Market, no tourists, no waterfront, no nada. We of course loved it that way, knowing no better. Likewise Faye Dunaway's wardrobe - pure &#34;Mad Men meets the Jet Age&#34; and complete with hats, lots of hats - is something you never saw in Boston then nor are very likely to see today. High-style we ain't, even now that we're rich and trendy. Same way with the beach house Steve McQueen was building on the dunes in Truro - I doubt they're still giving out building permits on fragile wetlands in a National Seashore, but hey, what the hell- it was a window into my past.Unfortunately, the pacing of the movie made me feel like it took from then until now to tell. The story - a crime caper overlaid with a romance between the mastermind and the insurance investigator - moves along with all the speed of an elderly tortoise on quaaludes. That and the really annoying multi-screen effects which no one but Hitchcock could do then and few can do as well now made the movie a non-starter, or rather, &#34;non-ender&#34; for me: it was so slow I couldn't watch the last twenty minutes. I have a life and things to do, and being bored to tears about a story I don't care about isn't one of them, no matter how nostalgic I might be about the days when Shreve's was on the corner of Arlington and Boylston or how you could pull up to the Ritz and park out front on what was then a two-way Newbury Street or have dinner at Joseph's, a restaurant which went out of business decades ago.McQueen isn't that believable as a rich businessman, Dunaway was gorgeous: just watching her (rotary) dial the phone was so erotic, and they did trouble themselves to hire minor players with Boston accents, but it was pretty thin compared to what it might have been, then or now.Two stars tops, and the second one's because I remember it all and it was nice to see Boston the way it used to be, but that's not much to hang a movie on - not one I want to watch 'til the end, anyway.",Time warp?

308674,0792840461,"I'm watching the original 'Thomas Crown Affair' on Blu-ray (2010 MGM/Fox pressing) as I write this and it is, as the package specs indicate, 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen-- no cropping evident.  The picture in most places is perceptibly sharper than the nicely remastered '05 MGM DVD (a fullscreen/widescreen flipper), although original grain elements are also enhanced, which can detract from the HD format's potential 'wow' factor, especially in soft-focus shots.  The disc is 50 GB dual-layer (AVC@40MBPS) and features the same commentary by director Norman Jewison that appears on previous DVD releases, as well as a theatrical trailer.  All things considered, I'd recommend this as a 30%-video/50%-audio upgrade from the '05 version.  4 stars for the film, 3 1/2 for presentation.",Solid Blu-ray release,2012-01-24,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308684,0792840461,"Even in 1968, audiences knew The Thomas Crown Affair was a film of style over substance. It had an interesting premise dreamt up by a Boston Lawyer who had never written a screenplay before-and there wasn't a lot of story or character development.  It's the films' style and gimmicks which endeared it to audiences. And the coolest of the cool stars,Steve (I move like a panther) McQueen, on the planet teamed up with the  fascinating mix of earthy sultriness and ice princess that is Faye Dunaway at her peak.So does this film hold up? Is it worth watching? The first half hour of the film - - the robbery is still an exciting, stylish, entertaining  sequence that few films will top in terms of hipness. It's here the multiple screen gimmick works best. It's here that Hal Ashby's editing and Walter Hill's second unit work is most impressive. It's the best part of the film and it works beautifully. (Yes that's future directors Hal Ashby and Walter Hill I just mentioned).Affair is directed by Norman Jewison (a former editor/turned director who had just directed In the Heat of the Night, and The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming). United Artists didn't put much pressure or time constraints on Jewison, and Jewison took this very weak screenplay with an interesting premise and worked with writer Alan R. Trustman to create a sandbox for him and legendary cinematographer Haskell Wexler to play in. They were young, they were anxious to break rules and try new things and they happened to wind up at Montreal Expo 67 and in the audience of a ground-breaking multi-screen extravaganza called Habitat. Habitat was created by film/maker and graphic designer Pablo Ferro. Jewison, Wexler and Ashby had found the gimmick they were looking for. It wasn't really until the film was in post production that they began putting together the multi-screen effects, and none of the film was story-boarded . A lot of improvisation was used for the film.The premise of the story (for the few who don't know) concerns a very wealthy corporate millionaire, Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) who is so used to winning at every game he plays, he challenges himself by quietly setting up and master-minding a huge bank robbery. It's one of the things that amuses him, one of the few thrills he has in life, his way to rebel and protest against his own corporate greed.The police are baffled, Paul Burke as top cop Eddie Malone is willing to work with a very unique insurance investigator to break the case. The investigator turns out to be Vicki Anderson (played by Faye Dunaway). She earns ten percent of the money she recovers and she's willing to do just about anything and break all the rules to earn her money- which frustrates the by the book Eddie Malone.Now there's never much time taken with conventional things like dialogue. Most of the characters speak in short phrases and sentences. The music is loud, intrusive, and obvious. It's used throughout the film to drive the pacing of the scene or over-emphasize minor moments. Today it plays a bit more campy than it used to, but it's a lot of fun.Vicki Anderson quickly decides that Thomas Crown must be the master-mind behind the bank robbery. She doesn't really have any evidence, or really much of a reason to come to this conclusion, but she does. The film expects you to accept this. So the rest of the film is a cat and mouse game. Vicki and Thomas are attractive jet-setting type people and they are attracted to each other, flirt, make love, drink port, play chess (in an extremely low key erotic fashion), buy fresh produce, go for dune buggy rides, and sit in sauna's together.They both know however that they are adversaries.McQueen's acting is also very stylized. He pauses before making facial gestures. He laughs somewhat forced, and his every movement feels calculated. It works.Although the film becomes less logical as it progresses, its inventive style held my attention throughout. And perhaps because of how dated it's hip chicness is, it's even more fun now,then when it was first released.The re-make is actually a better film than this one. The screenplay is much better constructed, and the film is structured better as a conventional narrative. But the first 30 minutes of this film is not easily topped, and Steve McQueen was a one of a kind screen presence.If your in the mood for a style over substance film from the late 60's complete with the title Academy Award Winning song Windmills of your Mind, you won't be disappointed.Three and Half .... make it Four...Chris Jarmick...",A Stylishly Chic Affair to Remember,2000-12-21,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"
308685,0792840461,"This is an extremely fine film. Besides a ingenious story and terrific acting by McQueen (who plays a ""cool"" and very wealthy businessman perfectly) and Dunaway (who looks absolutely stunning and plays it ""smart"" in nearly every scene), this movie has some fascinating and utterly BRILLIANT editing like no other film I know of... and a HAUNTING and GORGEOUS music score created by Michel LeGrand.What about the NEW version?I have been a huge fan of the original Thomas Crown Affair since I first saw it while in the military in 1969..... and bought the 1999 ""re-make"" because I heard so many good things about it.  I must say that honestly there are good points in BOTH films. I never quite bought the fact that the original wealthy ""Crown"" got his ""kicks"" robbing a bank.... so stealing the ""Monet"" made much more sense to me. I also thought the story was a bit more interesting in the new version and I was more satisfied by the challenge Bronsnan's character found in Russo's bluntness.Overall, however this 1969 ""Crown"" is the version I prefer. It contains an absolutely beautiful music score by Michel LeGrand (which is superior to the loud, lackluster and frangmented score that Bill Conti created for the new version). The title track here is ""Windmills of Your Mind"" is an awesome song, but also amazing is ""Her Eyes, His Eyes"" created for the infamous chess playing sequence.  I also prefer the sensuous and sexy elegance of the fire between McQueen and Dunaway to the overtly sweaty lust that Brosnan and Russo desparately share together... this film is more subtile and suggests sexuality.. which seems more fascinating than just the plain nakedness in the new version.Although I do prefer this film to the remake, both versions are well made and interesting in their own right, and should be enjoyed for what they are and what makes them so entertaining.",The Original Crown!,2004-05-20,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308688,0792840461,This movie was good when it came out and it has only gotten better.  While the plot always seemed a bit of a stretch the remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo was even more so.  And the ending of the original is so much better in my view.  This 1968 gem is just short of a classic and has really stood the test of time.  I have a 2 part test for whether or not I want to buy the DVD of a movie versus just rent.  The first is that I want to watch the movie in its entirety more than once over time and second is that I want to cue up certain scenes from time to time.

308689,0792840461,"Once again, why did they ever even think of remaking this movie?  Steve McQueen is at his best in his portrayal of Thomas Crown, a wealthy genius who is a mastermind for constructing elaborate bank robberies.  I really enjoyed the music in this film, particularly the way it interacts with the director's (Jewison) use of split screens.  While it's a dated technique, it really helps move the plot along without unnecessary cutting.  Additionally, the anonymity of his accomplices and the way that several loose ends come together to form the perfect robbery is best captured by this technique, in my opinion.Beyond McQueen's powerful performance, Faye Dunaway blows Rene Russo's remake performance out of the water.  Dunaway is smart, sexy, and knows how to handle herself.  While it's a bit slow in some parts, this movie is a psychological piece that focuses primarily upon the ""cat and mouse"" interplay between McQueen and Dunaway.  This is a ""battle of wits"" movie-not a pure action flick, as the remake might have you believe.  The ending is also extremely well done.  Rather than end on a typical Hollywood note, the final scenes of this film will leave you perplexed and wanting more of this film.

I must admit that I still have serious doubts about his acting abilities but his performance or shall we say his presence in this Norman  Jewison movie is one to be remembered.The 1968 label attached upon each  scene of the THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is, the least one can say, manifest. Split  screens &quot;&agrave; la DePalma&quot;, a GRADUATE-like title song doomed to be a  worldly hit, light critics of the american system and a  pseudo-revolutionary cinematography are the trademark of this film.In  spite of this artificial envelope, the movie still delivers. The seduction  scene between Faye Dunaway and SmQ when playing chess is absolutely  riveting and the hold-ups worthy to be seen several times.Of course, one  has to forget some gaps in the screenplay, for instance I still don't  understand how Faye Dunaway has determined by deduction alone that the  gangsters didn't know each other.Anyway, I liked this movie.A dandy  DVD.",STEVE  McQUEEN'S  LAUGH,2000-06-07,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

Understatement is the rule of thumb here and Norman Jewison directs this caper film effectively in that manner.  Steve McQueen never got the respect as an actor he deserved probably because he wasn't the most histrionic of actors.  Here he plays his emotions fairly tight to the vest which befits Thomas Crown.  McQueen is more than matched by Dunaway who plays an insurance investigator whose success in her field relies on her feminine wiles in tandom with her brains.  The sparks that eminate between McQueen and Dunaway are combustible and rare in a film.  The literal chess match between the two is more sensual than 100 films featuring couples making love.",Alluring Cat-and-Mouse Thriller,2005-12-24,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308704,0792840461,"Clever but slight, &#34;The Thomas Crown Affair&#34; is entertaining and stylish, which is all it was meant to be. The story begins with a carefully orchestrated bank robbery in downtown Boston. The ridiculously wealthy and monumentally bored Thomas Crown has planned it all to a T, and it comes off smoothly. It's hard to imagine anyone but Steve McQueen playing the role. &#34;Tommy&#34; is cool and remote, not given to displaying extremes of emotion either way. This is a big help when Vicki, the insurance investigator played by Faye Dunaway shows up. Her job is to recover the $2M stolen in the heist, and she fingers Tommy as having pulled off the bank job on little more a hunch.Vicki goes about chasing Tommy in plain sight. He doesn't mind getting caught, but isn't swept away by her charms until the justifiably famous chess scene. I wish Hollywood would return to making seduction scenes like this one. It is wordless for about 7 minutes. Tommy and Vicki keep their clothes on. Michel LeGrand's music is perfect throughout, but in this scene it does a lot of the talking for the characters.This is a quiet movie in many places; not what most people expect from a heist or caper movie. But that's really only one aspect of the story. The rest of it is games; mind games and the games rich people play. The split screens, which to many just scream &#34;1968&#34; actually move the story along, and they are so well constructed and presented that they aren't distracting. I will always stop and watch this movie whenever I see that it's on. The 1999 remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo was unnecessary and over the top. The remake is frenetic.

They were both terrifically talented people, but I don't think they are at their best in this film.  They are nice to look at, but the script doesn't give them much to work with.  The chess scene is very good, until they start smooching, when the soundtrack and choreography go out of control.The soundtrack is beautiful on its own, but is too intrusive during the film.It's a fluffy film with a thin plot, but it's fun to watch, if only to see McQueen and Dunaway in their prime.",Harmless fluff.,2005-06-06,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308709,0792840461,"I was interested in seeing this film after I saw the remake, especially when I heard so many people say the original was so much better. After having seen both, I'd call it a toss up (both were good!).Actually, the  remake was only loosely based on the original. The original is about a rich  guy who knocks off a bank, and the remake about a rich guy who steals  art.This film is well crafted and though the story is far fetched (as in  the remake) it's entertaining. Norman Jewison does a terrific job of  directing. His visual interpretations, camera angles and dramatic effects  are timeless. He overuses the split screen concept a bit, but we need to  remember that in 1968 this was fairly new technology and he was probably  enamoured with the novelty of it. Think of how much `morphing' was being  used when it was first developed.Probably the best scene involved the  chess match between Thomas (Steve McQueen) and Vicki (Faye Dunaway). It was  far more erotic than all the scenes where Rene Russo was running around  naked in the remake.The acting was excellent, with Dunaway taking top  honors as the stop-at-nothing insurance investigator who literally gets her  man. Steve McQueen played the rich macho ego maniac to perfection. His only  minus was his phony victory laugh, which was overacted and overused. Paul  Burke stayed appropriately but effectively on the sidelines as the police  detective.In comparing the two films, I'd have to say it's about even.  The remake had a more inventive and interesting story, replacing the bank  robbery with an art heist, but it was also more ridiculous in the final  disposition of the stolen painting. The original had better direction and  use of the camera, while the remake was much better in use of costumes,  props and sets in recreating the opulent lifestyle. Clearly the remake  benefited from 30 years of technological improvement in sound and film  quality.The remake was more self indulgent, especially in the sexual  area. The McQueen interpretation of Crown was more realistic than Brosnan's  conflicted and emotional distraught version. Each reflected their  respective times, but McQueen's character was a better representation of  the timeless arrogance of the ultra rich. I have to give Rene Russo a  slight edge as the investigator. She gave the character more complexity and  range. Paul Burke was far superior to Denis Leary as the cop.The ending  of the original was definitely superior, though each ending was really true  to the characters' personalities as portrayed.I gave this film an 8/10.  If you like classic films, and you enjoyed the remake, you will probably  enjoy this one as well.",Chess was never this much fun,2000-04-19,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308713,0792840461,"The original ""Thomas Crown Affair"" directed by Norman Jewison is one of the coolest movies ever made and great fun for all of its 100 minutes - a clever bank-heist caper combined with the sensual romance where both participants (the brilliant bank robber and his match, the sultry and shrewd insurance investigator) are sophisticated, quick-witted and oh so cool. The split-screen technique really works well in this movie and I should mention the song ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" by Michel Legrand that very deservingly received an Oscar - and it does not happen often in the best song categories.The chess game between ""King Of Cool"" Steve McQueen and 27 year old Faye Dunaway in the most provocative dress possible is one of the sexiest and most exiting without actual sex involved (my favorite kind of scenes - let my imagination work, let everything happen in my mind) scenes ever filmed. IMO, the 60s was one of the best dressed decades ever with the first wave of mini (and I mean it) skirts and elegant suits and dresses.From Faye Dunaway's interview to ""USA Today"" about working with McQueen, ""We had the most magical spark.

308714,0792840461,"Everything came together just right for Norman Jewison on this trendy caper:  McQueen (against type) and Dunaway (sharp as a knife), Alan R.

It is what it is, a product of it's time and a slick exercise in style; but it works as pure, detached entertainment.  The sloppy remake with Pierce Brosnan (too typecast) and Renee Russo (looking more like a drag queen than Dunaway could ever do in sixties haute couture) intriguingly tries to ground the conflicting emotions of the characters in reality, but the attempts at grown-up behavior and a stupid happy ending just defeats the concept.The blu-ray version is filmlike and true to the original presentation, the original mono sound is presented in 2-track DTS-HD and requires some cinema EQ.

""The Thomas Crown Affair"" then comes down to a battle of wits between these two as Anderson attempts to solve what in the beginning appears to be a perfect crime and eventually winds up in bed with her chief suspect.The film is smart, slick and in the end great entertainment.

308731,0792840461,"Thomas Crown is a millionaire but for some unexplained reason enlists a group of thieves to pull on a bank heist. It seems that the fun is in the game and not the money.Nobody does COOL like Steve McQueen and he is always a delight to watch on screen. Although this 1968 film looks seriously dated, Steve McQueen could walk out of the film and into the modern world without a second thought.The story goes over the top when Faye Dunaway enters as the cutthroat insurance investigator Vicky Anderson. She always gets her man and no doubt she'll get Thomas Crown in some way. The hard part of the story is knowing that Vicki knows Thomas Crown is behind the bank heist and he knows she knows. In fact, she tells him she is the insurance investigator for the crime. As it can only happen in filmland, they fall in love and a moral dilemma.I'm trying to watch all of Steve McQueen's movie so it is always fun to see his consistent style. He has the moves and the coolness factor to the max degree. He has a few scenes where he just laughs and laughs--odd, yes, but pulls it off. He also gets to show his driving skills in a great dune buggy scene with Dunaway. Could he do anything that wasn't cool?There are several weaknesses in this film--none of which involve Steve McQueen. Dialogue is minimal in this movie and you can go stretches with few words said. That might be OK if it didn't deter from a confusing story. Faye Dunaway is young and beautiful but in bizarre wardrobe. Her character Vicky Anderson would never wear just jeans and shirt. I listed to director Norma Jewison's commentary and he mentioned a young and upcoming fashion designer created Dunaway's fashions. Maybe it was high fashion for 1968 but it was outdated by 1969. She once looked like she was dressed in a ballarina outfit complete with leggings and all. Odd on all levels, especially with all her  big floppy hats.The movie soundtrack was irritating. It was some sort of 1960's funk that did not add appeal to the film. Of course, while saying that, I have to acknowledge that the opening song, WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND, won an Academy Award.While McQueen's Thomas Crown is cool and fun, Dunaway's Vicky Anderson is calculating and conniving. She is not above breaking the law to get evidence or to use the height of nastiness involving innocent people just to get a jump on her investigation. Will falling in love with Crown be her undoing. Will she betray him or will love conquer all?Jack Weston is flunkie hired by a mysterious man (Thomas Crown) to drive the getaway car after the heist. Weston is an underappreciated actor. He adds a bit of humanity to the film. He's probably not the height of immorality but yet he falls in to the criminal life.A new but overused technique in this film is the montage scenes of showing several scenes at the same time one screen. Commonplace now, it was new back then and Jewison used it over and over and over to the point of annoyance.THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR is one of many of Steve McQueen's famous films, so any fan has to watch this film.

308732,0792840461,"I recently saw, for the second time, Norman Jewison's clever 1968 caper, ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" and although I prefer the recent (1999) remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, this older version gives the new one a run for its money. The 60's flick is even superior in some ways. When I originally saw the movie, 30+ years ago, I was amazed at the cinematography, (the innovative Haskell Wexler behind the camera). The use of multiple screens, sometimes six or seven separate images at a time, during the robbery is extremely effective. The entire ""look"" of the film was new, experimental, hip, fresh. And it still looks good after all these years!Steve McQueen is outstanding as Thomas Crown, an edgy, jaded businessman, more anti-corporate than not. Crown wants to stick it to the system that he keeps beating. Arrogant and competitive, he is bored with winning the old fashioned way - legally. He wants to dabble in bank robbery for a change - more exciting than gliding and car racing any day. I don't think he plans on giving up his day job, however. He masterminds a meticulously planned heist on a Boston bank with great elan. The man is looking for thrills. He certainly doesn't need the cash. Four total strangers are hired, all experts in their particular line of burglary and embezzlement. None of them know Crown. Two million six hundred thousand dollars is the take - which had much more purchasing power in 1968 than the same amount nowadays! Crown flies to Switzerland after committing the perfect crime. He opens a secret bank account, making arrangements to pay-off the five men anonymously.Boston detective Eddy Malone, (Paul Burke), teams up with ruthless, but extremely attractive, independent insurance investigator Vicki Anderson, (Faye Dunaway - who is a relatively new face here. She had yet to appear in ""Bonnie and Clyde""). Ms. Anderson gets her kicks putting away folks who scam the system. And she's closing in on Crown, who has met his match. Of course there's sexual tension - but not as intense as the 1999 version. McQueen's Crown has a darker side than Brosnan's. And while Pierce is debonair, as ever, Steve looks somewhat awkward in three piece suits. Dunaway is a bit cooler, more serene, than the torrid Ms. Russo, but effective nevertheless. No nude scenes in this one, but lots of clothed chemistry. HOWEVER, the movie has the distinction of featuring the ""longest kiss in cinema history, with McQueen and Dunaway liplocked in one scene for 55 uninterrupted seconds."" Just a fact I picked up while writing the review.There's a terrific chess game in the film between Vicki and Thomas - I won't tell who wins, nor will I tell what happens afterward. The ending will come as a surprise to those of you who have yet to see this version of ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" The film makes for excellent entertainment. Nothing deep - just a good caper with an interesting look at the US culture of the late 60's....and McQueen and Dunaway, of course!""Windmills of your Mind,"" the movie's an Oscar winning song, scored by Michael Legrand, remains one of my favorites.JANA",A Classic Caper - McQueen & Dunaway Do A Long Liplock!!!,2005-08-18,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

I remember this film was a great departure for Steve McQueen and he still seems to have a thug-like quality to me.  Ms. Dunaway is a walking parade of late-sixties fashion, with lots of makeup and eyelashes.  Strange, I didn't ever realize she had a scar on her forehead.

And with no evidence, nothing to tie him to the crime, McQueen goes along with it and returns the money. Because some dumb blond tells him he's guilty? Duh! This was even too dumb for the swinging 60s. I can't understand how people rave about this dumb movie.

308754,0792840461,"Who has not dreamt of living the high life, being rich, famous, powerful and beautiful with the world at your feet, and with a penchant for achieving the impossible?  ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" provides for all this enchantment and more.  Starring a young and very athletic-looking Steve McQueen and an &uuml;berly sexy Faye Dunaway, it is a film that allows us a look into the life of the rich during the ""swinging 60's"".McQueen stars as Thomas Crown, an extremely shrewd, rich and powerful businessman to whom nothing is impossible.  After planning the bank robbery of the century, he gloats in the glory of his own triumph for no other purpose than the sake of the challenge in itself.  But soon he faces his true match, both in wit and brains, in Dunaway, who in the role of insurance investigator Vicki Anderson will give him the run of his life.  The two get entangled into a scheme of cat and mouse, dangerous but incredibly seductive.  Dunaway uses all her powers of seductive mischievousness to get her man in the famous chess scene.  Wearing a backless, pleated mini-dress, inch-long eyelashes and the longest of nails, she check-mates Thomas Crown in a way that he is obviously not used to.  The move makes him fall for Vicki instantly, even though he very well knows that she is after his head.This is a film with great quality of photography, where every scene has been carefully studied and could be used as a ""magazine layout"", to use the words of style expert Nina Garc&iacute;a, especially in the scenes where Faye Dunaway appears.  She is always superbly dressed and even more impeccably groomed.  Her hair, make-up - always featuring the inch-long eyelashes and the long, cream-coloured nails - her stylish suits, perfectly accessorized, are a true testament to the style of the era.  Just like Thomas Crown tells her during an auction, she looks as if she has just sprung out of the pages of Vogue.As far as plotlines go, the film does not provide for a very good one.  In fact, at times I found it confusing and hard to follow, even after watching it several times.  It is unclear as to how Thomas Crown is able to pull this most ingenious robbery in the first place, why everyone would trust him at face value (and not even that, as the men he hires to execute the robbery for him do not even know who he is), as well as to how Vicki arrives at the conclusion that he is the culprit (basically, she just looks at a picture of him and decides he is The One).  Even the dialogues are too simplistic.  Nevertheless, the film is worth watching as it provides for some very high class entertainment, and a lesson in how to forge one's own sense of style.",Rich and powerful in the 60's,2011-05-08,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308771,0792840461,"The Thomas Crown Affair exhibits all the worst excesses of late '60s filmmaking.  From the annoying, omnipresent theme (""Windmills of Your Mind"") to Faye Dunaway's bizarre hairdos, Barbie doll wardrobe, white eyeshadow and false eyelashes, to the pointlessly ""mod"" directorial quirks of Norman Jewison (multiple scenes onscreen simultaneously, quick cuts, diffusion, etc.), this is one bad acid trip of a movie.  The plot is slim, and the characters are all remarkably unintelligent for a caper film.  Usually, such films hinge on their characters' extraordinary expertise and/or analytical ability, but that certainly isn't the case here.  For instance, Faye Dunaway's character, a supposedly brilliant insurance investigator, takes one look at a picture of Steve McQueen and announces, ""That's it!  He's our man!""Within minutes, Faye and Steve are falling in love.  We know they're falling in love because the film skids to a halt in order to treat us to endless scenes of the two of them playing chess, riding in a dune buggy, haggling over melons in an outdoor market, and sharing the newspaper at breakfast as Michel LeGrand's overheated piano compositions thunder over the soundtrack.  The chess scene in particular is a dilly, close-up after close-up of Faye's shoulder undulating, Steve's eyelids flickering, Faye's finger stroking the oh-so-phallic bishop, Steve's lips quivering, etc. This all takes place over a period of YEARS before somebody finally kisses somebody, at which point the camera - you guessed it! - does not one, not two, but several dizzying 360 sweeps around the osculating couple.Finally, Faye asks Steve why he robs banks when he is, after all, a zillionaire.  Steve clenches his jaw, then smiles that brief, weary, cynical smile of his and says with a straight face, ""It's not about the money.  It's the system.  It's me against the system.""  Apparently, you could actually say this in 1968 without people exploding into gales of laughter.  Unfortunately for this film, the same cannot be said in 2005.","BEWARE!

In the spirit of examining this movie, I ask: Have you kids no sprit of adventure, no instincts to rebellion? Thomas Crown exhibited in spades the exact opposite of the conformity and benign contentment that I sense with some of the reviewers of this flick. In short, this guy was ALIVE!! Sure, some of the dialogue, etc. is dated. So will that of 2005 be in thirty years, I assure you. But Mr. Crown was more alive in his Boston-Brahmin prime than, I suspect, many of the reviewers are in theirs. Or maybe its just the times--we seem to be living in the '50's, redux. Sad. Anyway, buy this movie already and learn. Better yet, make yourselves a nice cold martini [if you know how] and get into the spirit of this.

308787,0792840461,"""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is a triumph of style over substance that, remarkably, is as stylish today as it was in 1968. Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) is a rich, thrill-seeking Boston businessman, unsatisfied with life's ordinary challenges. So he masterminds back robberies for the fun of it. He co-ordinates a 5-person heist of $2.6 million by telephone from his office. There is nothing to connect him to the crime. Police detective Eddie Malone (Paul Burke) hits a dead end, so the insurance company insists on bringing in a special investigator to assist Malone. She is beautiful, cunning Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway). Malone is skeptical of her abilities, but Thomas Crown cannot resist a challenge when Vicki tells him outright that she intends to nail him for the crime.There is nothing realistic about any of  this, and director Norman Jewison, who openly declared the film to be an exercise in style, doesn't pretend that there is. It was written by Boston lawyer Alan Trustman about idealized characters whose behavior does not strictly make sense. Nevertheless, Thomas Crown is iconic and appealing. Played against type by Steve McQueen, Crown is a sophisticate who wants to screw the system from which he has profited so richly. Crown can't stand a day without a challenge. He collects art, romances beautiful women, flies a glider plane, plays polo, and golfs on Sunday, because that is the only challenge available on Sundays. Asked what he has to worry about, Crown replies, ""Who I want to be tomorrow."" In the anti-establishment 1960s, he is a kind of posh anti-hero.Vicki Anderson is shrewd and admittedly mercenary. ""I'm immoral. So is the world. I'm here for the money, okay?"" she explains. Vicki gets ten percent of the money recovered. And she knows exactly how to get under Thomas Crown's skin. She doesn't bother to try to deceive him. She offers him a challenge upfront by declaring her intentions. Her unorthodox methods unnerve Malone. Oddly, though Vicki is gutsy and cunning, she seems ill-educated in the law and a little ditzy. She was written with one foot in and one foot out the door of 1960s feminism. Her relationship with Thomas Crown leaves the audience guessing. Is this a romance or a game of cat and mouse? Who's fooling whom? We can wonder while we watch the gorgeous couple do exciting, expensive things.Norman Jewison uses split screen when he wants the camera to be in more than one place at a time. It looks great. ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" was also one of the first films to use handheld cameras, by cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Jewison has spoken of how much creative freedom they had. They constantly experimented with the camera, creating memorable images and juxtapositions. Dialogue is spare. It's surprising how well a movie with little substance and lots of style holds up more than 40 years later. Don't expect depth or realism, but ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" does hold up. It's enjoyable. And, like its original audiences, I can't get its Oscar-winning theme song ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" out of my head now.The DVD (MGM 2005): This is a double-sided disc with widescreen on one side and full screen on the other. You're probably better off watching widescreen even if you don't have a widescreen television, because of the split screen multiple images in the film. Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and an audio commentary by director Norman Jewison. It's a good audio commentary with a little of everything. Jewison explains the rationale behind the split screens, talks about the cast, themes, camerawork, recalls filming. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, French.",This Triumph of Style Over Substance Is Still a Triumph 40 Years Later.,2012-01-30,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308805,0792840461,"Many reviewers have mentioned that, in all fairness, that they feel the Pierce Brosnan remake of this movie is just as good as Steve McQueen's original, if not better. Point taken, and ack, um, (me struggling to get the words out), they're right. The 1968 version is a little dated, the music is almost painful, and the Brosnan screenplay is definitely stronger. The acting in the latter version has to be noted, as well - Pierce Brosnan has that coolness, coldness and shrewdness that needs to be brought to the role of Tommy Crown, and had a different actor even attempted to re-do this movie, it could have been an eighty car pile-up. But Pierce, god love him, ain't McQueen, and that's why this version should be bought, downloaded, however you can get it (I bought the new transfer off of Amazon just this week). McQueen brings the actual belief to his role that not only would the character of Crown do something like hit a bank just for the thrill, but you can easily imagine Steve McQueen himself, offscreen, lighting a cigarette, saying, ""Ah, the hell with it,"" and doing the exact same thing, had the arms of Hollywood not reached out for him and given him all the material rewards he needed in his lifetime. Pierce...well, you never quite get past the feeling that his Thomas Crown, if it all came down to said and done, if it came down to that absolute moment of iciness, would say to Rene Russo (replacing Faye Dunaway from the original), ""So, shall we see which one of us wins this thing?"" Our man Steve would never let those words fleck from his lips; there's absolutely no doubt in his mind that he's gonna win, he's gonna get the lady and he's gonna spin dirt in everybody else's faces while he's doing it. Reviewing a movie with such a well-known plot is almost impossible, and I think that the best thing to do is to comment on the new transfer (much, much better than previous offerings, but still with an odd 'fuzzy' look and, here and there, murky sound to it that, despite this being made in the 1960s' does not seem to be intentional); the writing (again, the Brosnan version is more crisply written, but then, forty years later, the almost wordless chess scene between McQueen and Dunaway holds up, burns through the celluloid and needs no dialogue)and the original is interesting to watch for those 1968 cultural references, and character actors whom have slipped into some anonymity, unfortunately enough (remember the great Yapho Kotto?). When all is said and done, this is another Steve McQueen ""Don't you wish you were this cool?"" projects that, in fact, also offers good acting, able direction and production and a plot that does in fact get you to thinking about when is too much not enough, and what would you do to kickstart a stale morning?

Brosnan had the look, the chemistry with Russo as opposed to McQueen and Dunaway.  Now, Dunaway was younger then Russo, but Russo ran roughshod over her acting and sold me.  The writing and screenplays were sexier. John McTiernan was a better director than Norman Jewison.  If you're going criminal, then stealing art is way classier than robbing a bank.  I liked the fact that the only black character was a detective instead of a crook.  A gliding plane was way better than racing to dirty, gritty sand in a lumpy, bumpy sand dune buggy.  The scenery was untouchable in the 1999 version-caribbean hilltop villas, they flying scenery, the sailing scenes, polo, etc.  Quite frankly, screenplay was boring in the '68 version by comparison.

308819,0792840461,"The Thomas Crown Affair is one of the most stylized films I've ever seen.  The blocks within blocks style -- the same scene placed in miniature -- the unfocused lights, etc.  are really amazing to look at.The film is pretty to look at but the plot is quite thin.  The CEO of a major corporation decides to commit the perfect bank robbery on a whim.  He succeeds in taking the money thanks to five men who have no connection to each other nor to himself, and deposits the cash in a Swiss bank account.Meantime an insurance inspector is called in to catch him.  However, she falls in love with him which makes things a bit dicey with the police, the insurance company and with Tommy Crown!A lot of the scenes really have little to do with the plot but are stylized and pretty -- how many scenes of McQueen and Faye Dunaway on the beach zooming around in a dune buggy scaring seagulls?  How many kisses, and whispering sweet nothings?And don't get me started on the famous chess scene!The film is better known for its popular tune Windmills of Your Mind and for its later 1999 remake with Pierce Brosnan.Recommended for the dune buggy and colorized special effects, not to mention the chess scene!Other Steve McQueen Films:The Essential Steve McQueen Collection (Bullitt Two-Disc Special Edition / The Getaway Deluxe Edition / The Cincinnati Kid / Papillon / Tom Horn / Never So Few)Other Faye Dunaway Films:Eyes of Laura MarsMommie Dearest (Hollywood Royalty/Special Collector's Edition)",Stylish But a Thin Plot,2011-01-09,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308825,0792840461,"+++++This is an unusual movie where a bored millionaire named Thomas ""Tommy"" Crown (Steve McQueen) masterminds a huge bank job that's flawless and where he doesn't even have to set foot in the bank!  Instead, he hires five underlings (and he manages to keep his identity anonymous in hiring them) to perform simple tasks that, as a whole, combine together for criminal perfection.  But even though Crown has achieved perfection in the robbery, he can't maintain it after the event.Enter insurance investigator Vicky Anderson (Faye Dunaway).  She identifies Crown as the mastermind behind the caper just from looking at his picture!  She's out to get him but a problem ensues along the way: she falls in love with him.  Police detective Edward ""Eddy"" Malone (Paul Burke) makes sure that Vicky does not break too many rules in trying to catch her prey.The acting in this movie is terrific by Dunaway, Burke and, of course, movie legend Steve McQueen.  The background music is interesting even though sometimes it seems to be too loud and intrusive.  (The song ""Windmills of Your Mind"" won an Academy Award for Original Song.)  There are various movie-making techniques used especially split-screen imaging to keep the viewer interested.  There is even a clever ending.However, I had difficulty feeling for a guy who has everything.  There is hardly any tension that he might get caught as his accomplices (as mentioned above) don't even know him.  The sexual tension between McQueen and Dunaway is not maintained (even though, I must admit, that the chess scene between the two is very erotic).  This lack of tension causes the movie to become somewhat boring.In the 1999 remake, Crown actually does participate in the crime and so tension is created in the possibility that he might get caught.  As well, the sexual tension between him and the female insurance investigator is maintained.Finally, this DVD (New Transfer version) is, in my opinion, perfect in visual and audio quality.  It has one major extra.In conclusion, even though the story does not always keep you engrossed, this movie is priceless as an example of late 1960's filmmaking and gives the viewer a chance to see a major star in his prime!!*** 1/2(1968;  100 min;  widescreen;  32 scenes)+++++","What a bored millionaire does for ""kicks""",2006-04-25,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308827,0792840461,"All the kudos usually goes to Bullit, released the same year, yet with this movie, McQueen, the King of Cool, comes of age as an actor, at the height of his power as the No.1 Box office Hollywood star. Commonly regarded by critics as a triumph of style over substance, Jewison crafted a movie for the age and drew from McQueen the kind of performance of which few thought him capable. True, Dunaway's outfits (and Burke's hats) do cement the movie pretty firmly into its time period but anyone coming new to this movie who wasn't around at the time it was made has ample compensation in the luminosity of the stars, the fabulous jazz inspired Michel Legrand soundtrack, a gem of a performance from Jack Weston, as Erwin, and the famous chess game scene. Through the filter of McQueen's performance in the movie, picturing Brosnan as Crown in the recent remake is even more ludicrous than trying to picture Alec Baldwin as Doc McCoy: watch out for the scene in which Crown sets the 'ball rolling' by phoning up the members of the 'gang' he's hired to carry out the heist and then reflect on the observational skills of his detractors. His acting in this movie was matched only by that of his performances later in Papillon and the Getaway. Ultimately, the movie has stood the test of time and will continue to be watched long after DVDs of the Brosnan remake are gathering dust, deservedly, on the shelves of charity shops up and down the country.","Ice, just like ice!",2005-11-19,Jack Weston,1996-05-03,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Movies & TV, Movies"

308839,0792840461,"Thomas Crown, the film's protagonist suffers from an illness common to the idle rich: terminal boredom.  Though he's not completely idle--as a currency trader he does seem to come to work, at least occasionally.  Still, he runs his firm effortlessly--giving the appearance that he could give orders to his underlings in his sleep.  So what to do?  Start a foundation to help the world's poor?  Fight racism (this was 1968, after all!)?  Nope!  Recruit and pay anonymous thugs to rob a bank and endanger civilians with potential gun play--and then have a laugh by yourself in your mansion after the caper has been successfully pulled off!Luckily for Mr. Crown, and Steve McQueen who plays him, fate is about to send him a playmate to help beguile the intolerable tedium that is his life.  A freelance insurance investigator played by Faye Dunaway (the hot babe actress of that era) takes the job of tracking down the mastermind who had the nerve to mess with the banks.  She attends a polo match in which he is playing.  She speaks to him at a charity auction, making it clear to him that she is in hot pursuit.  A chess game at his mansion leads to a romantic relationship between the two.  So will she spring the trap that sends him to the clink--or will she run off with him to Rio or whatever and see what boring things the locals are up to?

Faye fails the test and looses Mr. Crown forever! The King-of-cool flies off into the sunset with the knowledge that he is financially independent and a very good judge of human behavior.

308843,0792840461,"After seeing the new Thomas Crown Affair in the theatre, I was pumped. It had me going from beginning to end. I figured since remakes tend to be worse then the original they are based on, the original Thomas Crown would be absolutly brilliant. Boy was I wrong. The only thing it had going for it was the experimantal camera work and the constant 60's pop culture split screening that made it feel like an episode of Love American Style, just not a funny. I was bored to tears and found myself fast forwarding through the tedious music montages. The bank heist was drab, at least compared to what our short attention span, MTV directors give us, and McQueen and Dunaway play to each other like a pair of dead fish. There is no eroticism and the famous chess scene made me feel dirty.  Take my advice. See the new one. It's sleek and well paced. Don't listen to your parents who haven't seen this movie since it came out in the theater. Or watch it with them and hear them say, &quot;You're right. That movie sucks.
